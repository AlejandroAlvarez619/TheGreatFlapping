You control a duck that’s being followed by a farmer. If the farmer gets you, you lose. You solve puzzles and platform to get items such as hay, pig feed, and so on
The more items you get, the more animals you can lead out of the farm
I'm imagining a pig pen, a cow pen, and a horse pen, and each one has its own platforming section or puzzle to get the item to release the respective animal.

Bashar Makani - Implementing/animating movement logic

Carlyne Ada - General goal is to have an environment set for the model to roam around. The environment has to seamlessly blend in farm life with the goal of platforming to escape from a farmer whilst still being visible and noticeable by players.

Alejandro Alvarez - My intended goal is to create an exciting gameplay loop which keeps the player engaged. This means simulated difficulty with either enemy movement, obstacles, or both.

Laura Wetherhold - 3D animation and 3D painting of characters in a cute, semi-realistic style
