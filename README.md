# The Great Flapping
Group Members: Bashar Makani, Laura Wetherhold, Alejandro Alvarez, Carlyne Ada 

You control a duck that is attempting to escape the shackles of being caged within a farm. Unfortunately, the farmer is NOT happy about this. The farmer is relentlessly pursuing you to grab you and put you back in the cage, ending the game. Your goal is to solve puzzles and platform through obstacles to get items such as hay, pig feed, and so on. The more items you get and the more animals you can lead out of the farm, the higher your score is.
